## 🎯 Core Game Rules

### 🏆 Victory Goal

Place queens on the colorful board satisfying the following **triple constraints**:

1. **Row Constraint**: Exactly one queen per row
2. **Column Constraint**: Exactly one queen per column  
3. **Region Constraint**: Exactly one queen per color region

### 👑 Queen Placement Rules

- **Adjacent Contact Limitation**: Queens cannot touch each other in any of the 8 adjacent positions

  ```
  ❌ ❌ ❌
  ❌ 👑 ❌  ← These 8 positions cannot have other queens
  ❌ ❌ ❌
  ```

- **Color Region Limitation**: Only one queen allowed per color region

### 🎮 Controls

1. **First tap**: Empty cell → ❌ (marker)
2. **Second tap**: ❌ → 👑 (place queen)
3. **Third tap**: 👑 → Empty cell (clear)

- Color regions add complexity to spatial reasoning
- Creates puzzle types impossible in traditional N-Queens

### 🔴 Smart Conflict Indicators

- **Golden Queen** 👑: Follows all rules
- **Red Queen** 🔴: Rule conflicts detected
- Real-time visual feedback helps players learn and improve

### 📊 Progressive Difficulty

- **Beginner Levels**: 3x3, 4x4 small boards, simple region divisions
- **Intermediate Levels**: 5x5, 6x6 medium boards, complex region shapes
- **Advanced Levels**: 7x7+ large boards, irregular region challenges
- **Community Levels**: Player-created creative puzzles

## 🧠 Strategy & Tips

### 🎯 Basic Strategies

1. **Analyze most constrained regions first**: Find positions with fewest choices
2. **Utilize region boundaries**: Boundary positions often have more restrictions
3. **Elimination method**: Mark impossible positions systematically

### 🔥 Advanced Techniques

1. **Triple cross-analysis**: Consider row, column, and region constraints simultaneously
2. **Hypothesis testing**: Try placements and analyze subsequent possibilities
3. **Symmetry utilization**: Identify and leverage board symmetry patterns
